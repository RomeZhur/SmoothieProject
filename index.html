		<p class="wrapper__text">In the 1880s, football became popular in the community. The number of clubs in the Football Association exceeded 100. At the same time, rumors began to circulate that some clubs were paying salaries to the players,
			and according to the original concept of the association, football is a purely amateur sport. Therefore, in 1882, the following clause was added to the rules: Any player in the club who receives from the club
			remuneration in any form or monetary compensation in excess of his personal expenses or funds, in connection with entering a particular game, is automatically removed from
			Cup competitions, any FA competitions and international tournaments. The club that has hired such a player is automatically excluded from the Association.
